# Lua Scripts

This repository is about the scripts **I** have made.
 Please do not claim these scripts as yours.
 The scripts here are designed to be used with [Roblox exploits](https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Exploit), otherwise known as "hacks".
 <br />
 <br />
Example Script:
<br />
```
local plr = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local char = plr.Character

local function changeSpeed(speed)
  local humanoid = char:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
  
  humanoid.WalkSpeed = speed
end

changeSpeed()
```
##
- Before I made this repository, these scripts were private.
- The scripts in this repository are mostly for R6.
- These scripts were made directly in [Roblox Studio](https://create.roblox.com/).
